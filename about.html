                      <p>It happened, again. My husband just walked his toe <i class="fas fa-shoe-prints" style="color: #87EED5;"></i> right into the bookshelf. Clumsiness aside,
                        we all should be able to freely walk our living rooms, regardless of size, sans fear of pain.
                      <p>Determined to find a solution, while he was at work the next day, with a Hulk-like strength<img src="images/icons/icons8-hulk.png" style="height: 25px;">that only appears during interior decorating-spurts,
                        I rearranged our furniture. Then I waited and observed. He would run into something else <i class="fas fa-couch"></i>. So I’d rearrange again,
                        then observe again.
                      <p>After a few attempts, we finally had a solution &mdash; we cut off <i class="fas fa-hand-scissors"></i> his toe. Kidding! We found a layout that worked best
                        for both of us and that looked as nice as possible without replacing or removing our furniture.
                      <p>Then I found UX design in a TedTalk and a documentary. Finally, a name and CAREER to my hobby and skills. I immediately
                        researched programs to learn how to utilize my expertise and learn design tools and chose <a href="https://www.bloc.io/designer-track">Bloc’s Designer Track</a>.

                        <p>You know that feeling when you’re overcome with excitement and don’t want the conversation to end, so you keep picking at the food on the table and ordering more coffee, all because you’ve found someone who talks about the circular economy as excitedly as you do? These conversations continually convince me of the power of design and the need to think holistically.

                        <div id="color">what brought me here</div>
                        <p>As a new business designer within the social innovation sector, I’ve had the unique opportunity to design programs that try to solve challenging problems in resource-poor environments like affordable housing finance in Haiti and agricultural input centers in Bangladesh.
                        <p>A couple of years ago, led by my interest in human-centered design, I wanted to become a UX designer. I enrolled in Bloc’s design bootcamp and am now proficient in HTML, CSS, Adobe Creative Cloud,  Sketch, Balsamiq, and Figma. However, after designing and coding this portfolio, I realized that I really enjoy the business end of design. So now, I mix my design and business tools to guide my processes. For instance, I created a proposal design canvas - inspired by the Business Model Canvas - that I used to develop projects. Here is the <a href="images/case-haiti.pdf">case study</a> where I use this tool.
