                        <h4>why design?</h4>
                        <p>After, probably, the 5th time in a week my husband
                          exclaimed in pain after stubbing his toe into our IKEA wall
                           unit, I could no longer blame clumsiness. I had originally
                           designed our living room with only myself in mind. But as
                           I mentally recorded his <span>pain</span> points, I found a
                           better way to reorganize the space. So, I cleared a path that
                           allowed him to walk through comfortably and free of stubbed toes.
                        <p>I loved the feeling of finding a free solution to this challenge.
                          I especially enjoyed how it included working with him to get there.
                          Further, I loved how it included a creative element of aesthetic design.
                        <p>Design allows you to create holistic systems, processes, or even
                          apartment layouts that make sense, and yet, are also pretty.
                          This is something I wanted to do.
                        <h4>what's your experience?</h4>
                        <p>I have more than 8 years' experience designing development programs that
                          take place in resource-poor environments, mainly in developing countries.
                          <p>My expertise is in interviewing people, identifying partnerships, and
                          creating strategies. I have worked in agriculture, entrepreneurship and
                          business development, trade, ICT, fintech, and development finance. Most
                          recently, through interviews with large software companies, credit unions,
                          and women microentrepreneurs, I helped design a program that combines a regional-wide
                          digital payments platform with a microfinance and women's business
                          development initiative in the Philippines. Fingers-crossed it works!
                          <p>I've always been intrigued by human behavior and learning new cultures.
                            Which is probably why my undergrad is in international economics.
                        <h4>full circle</h4>
                        <p>Although designing programs is exciting, I wanted to design products or larger systems,
                          like websites, company structures, internal processes, and marketing/communications strategies.
                          I like figuring out how things and people work together, then working with the group
                          to test and find solutions or improvements.
                        <h4>now let's go way back</h4>
                        <p>I was born in Brooklyn then moved to NJ at a young age. I have a younger
                          brother - who is a <a href="www.cokuyan.com">computer engineer (he's a back-end whiz)</a>.
                          We grew up with 19 of our 23 first cousins - the rest were in Turkey. So, I'm used
                          to hectic environments. I speak English, Turkish, and used to speak Spanish. My
                          Italian is still new, but I am being tutored by a neighbor.
