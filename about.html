                        <h3>who am i?</h3>
                        <p>I am a consummate daydreamer, lover of hyperbole, and story-teller.
                        <p>As a kid, I loved telling stories. The ability to make someone laugh or
                          even cry over a story you just told was addictive. My parents saw a future
                          politician. I wasn’t sure what I saw, I just loved sharing stories - mine,
                          Amber Brown’s, Aesop’s, and everyone else’s.
                        <p>I also loved figuring things out. Whether it’s people or computers. As an
                          elementary and middle school-aged kid, I used to spend hours taking apart my
                          computer and then putting it back together.  Unfortunately, I never saw computer
                          science as something I would do. That’s what the smart, quieter people were doing.
                          I was a bit obnoxious defending classmates from teachers - I looked more like a lawyer.
                        <p>However, my absolute favorite thing to do is make things pretty. I would redecorate
                          my bedroom every two years and never had a cubicle or office that wasn’t decorated. As
                          the daughter of a trained architect (later becoming an entrepreneur who owns custom framing
                          shops in NY) and a FIT graduate (currently the best public school bus driver), I was destined
                          to pay attention to the detail and appreciate beauty and quality.

                    <div class="two-thirds">
                        <h3>what have i been up to?</h3>
                        <p>My journey to now: a freelance UX designer living in Milan, includes more than 8 years
                          working in international development, where according to Malcolm Gladwell, I became an
                          expert in development finance and agriculture, and got paid to travel to Myanmar, Kosovo,
                          Haiti, Bangladesh, Guatemala, Kenya, and most recently the Philippines. It also includes
                          an underlying story of self-discovery and an MBA.
                        <p>From 2010 until July 2018, I was a business development professional, designing and writing
                          grants and contracts for USG-funded programming in developing countries and designing and implementing
                          marketing strategies to raise company visibility. My experience was mainly with small companies - with
                          a maximum of 40 people and a 5-person business development team. I wore a lot of hats and got a lot of
                          opportunities:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Won millions of dollars for programs in resource-poor areas</li>
                            <li>Designed information architecture and design of SharePoint sites for two companies and managed
                              the company transition</li>
                            <li>Was a keynote speaker for NATCCO - a national credit union association in the Philippines,
                              discussing the importance of technology in financial inclusion</li>
                            <li>Designed and wrote content for websites</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>However, most rewarding and interesting, has been the user research during program design. I firmly
                          believed and was often shown that solutions lie within the communities that were facing the challenges.
                          I was only needed to kickstart their ideas or speed up activities with fundraising. I also learned that
                          the ideas or programs that took a community-based approach were the most successful and had the most
                          beneficial side-effects like increased savings.
                        <p>Now, I’m an MBA student at SDA Bocconi, specializing in product development, marketing, and innovation.
                          I’ll be getting the management background and understanding I’m confident I’ll need in the future.
                        <h3>the revolutionary moment</h3>
                        <p>“OW!”
                        <p>It happened, again. My husband just walked his toe right into the bookshelf. Even if it was his clumsiness,
                          he shouldn’t have to be careful while walking around in his living room - even if it was tiny. There had to
                          be a better way.
                        <p>While he was at work the next day, with a Hulk-like strength that only appears during interior decorating-spurts,
                          I rearranged our furniture. Then I waited and observed. He would run into something else. So I’d rearrange again,
                          then observe again.
                        <p>After a few attempts, we finally had a solution - we cut off his toe. Kidding! We found a layout that worked best
                          for both of us and that looked as nice as possible without replacing or removing our furniture.
                        <p>That end-solution created a level of elation that single-handedly winning a $7 million program to create an affordable
                          housing market in Haiti could not. I wanted to do more than just win a proposal. I wanted to create and work through
                          something until it worked, while also addressing my love of making things pretty.
                        <p>Then I found UX design in a TedTalk and a documentary. Finally, a name and CAREER to my hobby + skills. I immediately
                          researched programs to learn how to utilize my expertise and learn design tools and chose Bloc’s Designer Track. Thanks
                          to them, I now can claim all of the following skills:
