                        <p>I'm a UX designer with expertise in business development and strategy.
                          Sector-agnostic, my main role is to help manage and guide you to reach
                          your goal, whether it's a website, a project, or a product. I've worked in
                          financial services, agriculture, entrepreneurship, and art.

                      <p>It happened, again. My husband just walked his toe <i class="fas fa-shoe-prints" style="color: #87EED5;"></i> right into the bookshelf. Clumsiness aside,
                        we all should be able to freely walk our living rooms, regardless of size, sans fear of pain.
                      <p>Determined to find a solution, while he was at work the next day, with a Hulk-like strength<img src="images/icons/icons8-hulk.png" style="height: 25px;">that only appears during interior decorating-spurts,
                        I rearranged our furniture. Then I waited and observed. He would run into something else <i class="fas fa-couch"></i>. So I’d rearrange again,
                        then observe again.
                      <p>After a few attempts, we finally had a solution &mdash; we cut off <i class="fas fa-hand-scissors"></i> his toe. Kidding! We found a layout that worked best
                        for both of us and that looked as nice as possible without replacing or removing our furniture.
                      <p>Then I found UX design in a TedTalk and a documentary. Finally, a name and CAREER to my hobby and skills. I immediately
                        researched programs to learn how to utilize my expertise and learn design tools and chose <a href="https://www.bloc.io/designer-track">Bloc’s Designer Track</a>.

                        <p>My journey includes more than 8 years of
                          working in international development, where &mdash; according to Malcolm Gladwell &mdash; I became an
                          expert in development finance and agriculture, and got paid to travel to Myanmar, Kosovo,
                          Haiti, Bangladesh, Guatemala, Kenya, and most recently the Philippines. It also includes
                          an underlying story of self-discovery and an MBA.
                        <p>From 2010 until July 2018, I was a business development professional, designing and writing
                          grants and contracts for USG-funded programming in developing countries and designing and implementing
                          marketing strategies to raise company visibility. My experience was mainly with small companies - with
                          a maximum of 40 people and a 5-person business development team. I wore a lot of hats and got a lot of
                          opportunities:

                        <p>However, most rewarding and interesting, has been the user research during program design. I firmly
                          believed and was often shown that solutions lie within the communities that were facing the challenges.
                          I was only needed to kickstart their ideas or speed up activities with fundraising. I also learned that
                          the ideas or programs that took a community-based approach were the most successful and had the most
                          beneficial side-effects like increased savings.
                        <p>Now, I’m an MBA student at <a href="https://www.sdabocconi.it/en/mba-executive-mba/full-time-mba">SDA Bocconi</a>, specializing in product development, marketing, and innovation.
