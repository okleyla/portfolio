            <h2>you can call me rose or G</h2>
            <p>I am a UX designer with 8 years’ experience in
            strategy and project development. I work full-time at WOCCU, where I
            am designing and managing our company’s transition to SharePoint, develop
            content for web and print, and manage & design development finance projects
            in emerging economies.
            <p>On the side, I am a freelance UX/UI designer and marketing consultant
              to small businesses and start-ups.
            <p>I found myself in design after watching a TedX Talk by David Butler,
              Coca-Cola’s first and former global head of design. You can watch it
              <a href="">here</a>. Then reading his book, which you can find
              <a href="">here</a>. He applied design principles on business operations
              to create a new system that made the large company operate as a start-up,
              always prototyping and innovating, and in the process saveed them over
              $500 million.
              <p>The potential of design - making things practical, usable, and
                beautiful - excited me.
              <p>So I started with designing and writing projects in resource-poor
                countries. Little by little, I’ve increased my skills in design
                software and Microsoft products. Now I also help small businesses
                with strategy, marketing, and user experience.
              <p>I love traveling, getting to know people, and learning new things.
                Most recently, I was in rural Philippines interviewing women
                entrepreneurs. And my next trip is Milan!</p>
