                      <h3>Origin Story</h3>
                      <h2 style="padding-top:2rem;">“OW!”</h2>
                      <p>It happened, again. My husband just walked his toe <i class="fas fa-shoe-prints" style="color: #87EED5;"></i> right into the bookshelf. Clumsiness aside,
                        we all should be able to freely walk our living rooms, regardless of size, sans fear of pain.
                      <p>Determined to find a solution, while he was at work the next day, with a Hulk-like strength<img src="images/icons/icons8-hulk.png" style="height: 25px;">that only appears during interior decorating-spurts,
                        I rearranged our furniture. Then I waited and observed. He would run into something else <i class="fas fa-couch"></i>. So I’d rearrange again,
                        then observe again.
                      <p>After a few attempts, we finally had a solution - we cut off <i class="fas fa-hand-scissors"></i> his toe. Kidding! We found a layout that worked best
                        for both of us and that looked as nice as possible without replacing or removing our furniture.
                      <p>That end-solution created a level of elation that single-handedly winning a $7 million program to create an affordable
                        housing market in Haiti could not. I wanted to do more than just win a proposal. I wanted to create and work through
                        something until it worked, while also addressing my love of making things pretty.
                      <p>Then I found UX design in a TedTalk and a documentary. Finally, a name and CAREER to my hobby + skills. I immediately
                        researched programs to learn how to utilize my expertise and learn design tools and chose Bloc’s Designer Track. Thanks
                        to them, I now can claim all of the following skills:

                        <h3>what have i been up to?</h3>
                        <p>My journey to becoming a freelance UX designer living in Milan, includes more than 8 years
                          working in international development, where according to Malcolm Gladwell, I became an
                          expert in development finance and agriculture, and got paid to travel to Myanmar, Kosovo,
                          Haiti, Bangladesh, Guatemala, Kenya, and most recently the Philippines. It also includes
                          an underlying story of self-discovery and an MBA.
                        <p>From 2010 until July 2018, I was a business development professional, designing and writing
                          grants and contracts for USG-funded programming in developing countries and designing and implementing
                          marketing strategies to raise company visibility. My experience was mainly with small companies - with
                          a maximum of 40 people and a 5-person business development team. I wore a lot of hats and got a lot of
                          opportunities.<!--:
                        <ul class="examples">
                            <li class="first" id="one">Acquired more than $80 million for programs in resource-poor areas:
                              affordable housing in Haiti and a fintech study in the Philippines</li>
                            <li class="second" id="two">Designed information architecture and design of SharePoint sites for two companies and managed
                              the company transition</li>
                            <div class="clearfix"></div>
                            <li class="first" id="three">Keynote speaker for a Filipino national credit union association's annual conference,
                              to discuss the importance of technology</li>
                            <li class="second" id="four">Designed layout, edited photos, and wrote content for websites and marketing materials for more than 5 companies</li>
                            <div class="clearfix"></div>
                        </ul>-->
                        <p>However, most rewarding and interesting, has been the user research during program design. I firmly
                          believed and was often shown that solutions lie within the communities that were facing the challenges.
                          I was only needed to kickstart their ideas or speed up activities with fundraising. I also learned that
                          the ideas or programs that took a community-based approach were the most successful and had the most
                          beneficial side-effects like increased savings.
                        <p>Now, I’m an MBA student at SDA Bocconi, specializing in product development, marketing, and innovation.
                          I’ll be getting the management background and understanding I’m confident I’ll need in the future.
