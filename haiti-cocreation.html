                      asked us to design "blue sky" financial inclusion projects
                      to advance financial inclusion in Haiti. Working with local
                      financial institutions, existing savings and loans groups,
                      and other implementer, I led my team to design a $5m, 3-year
                      financial services program. The project focuses on financial
                      education, mobile money, and linking them to the formal
                      financial sector, using a field officer banking
                      methodology.</h3>

                        the region. This helped us realize that it would probably

                    the competitive landscape). Once our ideas were better
