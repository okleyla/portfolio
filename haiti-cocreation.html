                    informal rural savings and loan groups to formal credit

                    in January 2017, I worked with USAID, local financial
                    institutions, our staff in Haiti, finance experts, and
                    colleagues in DC to co-create the Haiti Accessible

                  <h3>Responding to donor requests are challenging - they expect
                    a detailed program and program team within a short span of
                    time. I always begin by trying to understand what we need to
                    learn. To help guide me through this, I developed a
                    <a href="images/proj-dev-canvas.pdf">project development canvas</a>
                    - my take on the business model canvas. It keeps
                    me focused on defining the challenge or constraints, value
                    proposition, my company’s advantages, beneficiaries,
                    key partners, key metrics, and potential private-sector
                    partners that can contribute to the project.</h3>
                  <h3>Initially, I create a list composed of my guiding principles
                    and questions I want to be answered. For this project, my
                    list was short:
                  <ul>
                      <li>The project has to be organic to ensure sustainability.
                        Haiti has a long history of failed projects and corruption.
                        I wanted to focus on something that was already created
                        by Haitians.</li>
                      <li>Why weren’t financial services reaching rural areas?</li>
                      <li>How much innovation was the client comfortable with?</li>
                  </ul></h3>
              </div>
              <div class="half-right">
                  <h3>Our main goal was to create a project that was organic, rather
                    than forcing something new while crossing our fingers hoping
                    it would work. Since we had been working in Haiti for more
                    than 9 years, I had a good understanding of the financial
                    system, both formal and informal. So, we wanted to work with
                    existing, yet informal, savings and lending groups in rural
                    Haiti to transform them into formal groups. Credit unions are
                    modeled similarly to these rural groups and WOCCU has a time-
                    tested model called field officer banking that incorporates
                    groups into their membership while creating individual accounts
                    - allowing for individual and group services. And most importantly,
                    it allows individuals to develop a relationship with formal
                    financial institutions, creating access to products and services
                    they had not had before.</h3>

                        First, I conducted a thorough literature review,
                        compiling questions and creating brainstorming notes.
                        I used these notes to figure out who I should meet with
                        while in the country vs virtually as well as to create a

                      <h3>In Haiti, I conducted around 15 interviews over 2 weeks
                        and held brainstorming sessions with WOCCU’s staff in Haiti.
                        The interviews were with the client (USAID), other donors
                        in the country, potential competitors, NGOs conducting
                        similar or complementary programs, government officials,

                          <li>Competitive Landscape: It was a crowded field.
                            Almost every organization working in financial
                            services was bidding on the program. We had to
                            highlight our advantage and value proposition over them.</li>
                          <li>Digital finance regulation was improving, albeit slowly.</li>
                          <li>Lack of connection between regulators and what was
                            happening on the ground.</li>
                          <li>Financial institutions were afraid to provide
                            services and products to rural households due to a
                            perceived risk.</li>
                          <li>Limited knowledge of finance and the use of cell
                            phones could hinder fintech growth.</li>
                          <li>Small business growth was limited, as was the drive
                            to innovate and create in the financial sector.</li>
