            <h1>classics reimagined</h1>
            <p>The entrepreneur (Darcy) behind ReFated Shoes, or RF, is an artist with
              impeccable style. Bored of the basic blacks and browns, he hand-painted his
              own shoes in vibrant hues, patina patterns, and however else inspiration took
              hold of his paint brush. To his surprise, colleagues and passersby were offering
              to buy the shoes off his feet. So, he decided to take his hobby online.
            <p>After a successful stint on Etsy, the entrepreneur decided that it was time to
              host his own site and define his brand. Enter: me. My role was to help him with
              strategy, marketing, and design.</p>

                  <h2>starting from the sole up</h2>
                  <p>Since we were going from an Etsy site to a stand-alone e-commerce site,
                    we needed a better understanding of the environment: who else was doing this?
                    How will we convince strangers to buy these shoes? Where should we market the new
                    site? And most importantly, how do we set ourselves up to compete?</p>

                  <h3>Who's Out There?</h3>
                  <p>During the stakeholder interview, Darcy identified a few other companies
                  with a similar business model:</p>
                  <div class="clearfix"></div>
                  <ul class="inspo">
                      <li><img src="images/inspo1.png" class="third"></li>
                      <li><img src="images/inspo2.png" class="third"></li>
                      <!--<li><img src="images/inspo3.png" class="sixth"></li>
                      <li><img src="images/comp1.png" class="sixth"></li>-->
                      <li><img src="images/comp2.png" class="third"></li>
                      <!--<li><img src="images/comp3.png" class="sixth"></li>-->
                  </ul>
                  <!--<div class="box"><p></p></div>-->
                  <div class="clearfix"></div>
                  <p>Design pattern: the direct competitors use stone/slate textures and colors,
                    while the sources of inspiration rely on a black and white color scheme with
                    brightly colored calls-to-action.</p>

              <div class="user-research">
                  <h3>But first, what do the people want?</h3>
                  <p>Considering the distinct nature of this business - painting second-hand,
                    vintage, or out-of-season shoes - we had to figure out how to properly
                    market the product. We also needed to identify the target customer.
                    The first survey, with 33 respondents, reconfirmed what we knew:</p>
                  <div class="survey-results">
                      <ul class="survey">
                          <li><span>87.9%</span> mostly consider quality & style to purchase shoes</li>
                          <li><span>75.8%</span> would purchase shoes online</li>
                          <li><span>48%</span> would buy or consider buying refurbished shoes</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>And gave us our target customer: out of the 87.5% of respondents
                        who would pay between $100-$300 for a pair of shoes AND would purchase
                        shoes online, 50% of them would consider buying refurbished shoes.</p>
                  </div>

                  <div class="survey-results">
                      <p>The second survey, with <span>133 respondents</span>, and third survey gave
                        insight into word choice: </p>
                      <ul class="survey">
                          <li><span>54.3%</span> would consider buying hand-dyed shoes</li>
                          <li><span>25.4%</span> would buy hand-dyed shoes</li>
                          <li><span>"used"</span> most resembled "refurbished"</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>I conducted another survey to test whether it was the term “refurbished” or the concept
                        behind RF that turned customers away. The word refurbished had to change, so we decided
                        on hand-painted. This term tested well during the website prototype.</p>

                      Negative comments were mostly directed towards the concept, rather than
                      the design. This was alleviated by providing additional information on the

                  <h2>what i learned from this experience</h2>
                  <p>In retail, photography is just as important as the site design.
                    To dispel concerns of condition and quality, the users requested
                    more photos of the finished product as well as the painting process.
                  <p>We discovered that customers want to learn about products prior to
                    purchasing them. In the future, we will explore embedding videos on
                    the website and social media platforms.</p>
