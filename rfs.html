              <h1>making men's shoes cool</h1>
              <p>The entrepreneur (Darcy) behind ReFated Shoes, or RF, is an artist with
                impeccable style. Bored of the basic blacks and browns, he hand-painted his
                own shoes in vibrant hues, patina patterns, and however else inspiration took
                hold of his paint brush. To his surprise, colleagues and passersby were offering
                to buy the shoes off his feet. So, he decided to take his hobby online.
              <p>After a successful stint on Etsy, the entrepreneur decided that it was time to
                host his own site and define his brand. Enter: me. My role was to help him with
                strategy, marketing, and design.</p>

          <section class="intro">
              <h2>starting from scratch</h2>
              <p>We needed a better understanding of the environment - who else was doing this?
                How will we convince strangers to buy these shoes? Where should we market the new
                site? And most importantly, how do we set ourselves up to compete?</p>
          </section>
          <section class="competition">
              <h3>Who's Out There?</h3>
              <p>During the stakeholder interview, Darcy identified his competitors and inspiration:</p>
              <div class="inspo-comp">
                  <ul class="images">
                      <li><img src="images/inspo1.png"></li>
                      <li><img src="images/inspo2.png"></li>
                      <li><img src="images/inspo3.png"></li>
                      <li><img src="images/comp1.png"></li>
                      <li><img src="images/comp2.png"></li>
                      <li><img src="images/comp3.png"></li>
                  </ul>
              </div>
              <div class="box"><p></p></div>
              <p>Design pattern: the direct competitors use stone/slate textures and colors,
                while the sources of inspiration rely on a black and white color scheme with
                brightly colored calls-to-action.</p>

          <section class="user-research">
              <h3>User Research</h3>
              <p>Considering the distinct nature of this business: of painting second-hand,
                vintage, or out of season shoes, we needed a better understanding of how to
                market to the target customer. We also needed to identify the target customer.</p>
              <p>1st Survey: 33 respondents</p>
                  <ul class="survey">
                      <li><span>87.9%</span> mostly consider quality & style to purchase shoes</li>
                      <li><span>75.8%</span> would purchase shoes online</li>
                      <li><span>48%</span> would buy or consider buying refurbished shoes</li>
                  </ul>
              <p>The seven out of eight (87.5%) respondents who would pay between $100-$300 for a
                pair of shoes, who would also purchase shoes online and 50% would consider buying
                refurbished shoes.
              <p>2nd Survey: 133 respondents</p>
                  <ul class="survey">
                      <li><span>54.3%</span> would consider buying hand-dyed shoes</li>
                      <li><span>25.4%</span> would buy hand-dyed shoes</li>
                      <li><span>"used"</span> most resembled "refurbished"</li>
                  </ul>
              <p>We had to replace the word "refurbished".
              <p>I conducted another survey to test whether it was the term “refurbished” or the concept
                behind RF that turned customers away. The word refurbished had to change, so we decided
                on hand-painted. This term tested well during the website prototype.</p>

              <h3>Mapping</h3>
              <p>We conducted a card sort to help organize the website and discover
                whether additional pages were needed. We learned that the potential
                customer wanted to learn more about the product, with multiple survey
                respondents suggesting a section devoted to hand-painting techniques.</p>

                Marcus' through Instagram and Facebook, while the Jean's would learn
                through word-of-mouth. Accordingly, I designed the below user flow to

              </div>
              <p>We conducted multiple rounds of guerilla testing and online user testing
                through Invision. Overall, we received positive feedback on the shoes and
                the website. Survey respondents were intrigued by the concept and the
                entrepreneur, while others were keen to order shoes from the prototype.
                Negative comments were mostly directed towards the concept, rather than
                the design. This was alleviated by providing additional information on the
                dyeing process and on the specific shoes that are being sold.</p>

              </ul>

              <h3>Membership</h3>
              <p>Darcy’s goal is to include membership services once he builds a
                larger following. So, we planned for the future and designed an
                account page.</p>

              <h3>what i leared from this experience</h3>
              <p>In retail, photography is just as important as the site design.
                To dispel concerns of condition and quality, the users requested
                more photos of the finished product as well as the painting process.
              <p>We discovered that customers want to learn about products prior to
                purchasing them. In the future, we will explore embedding videos on
                the website and social media platforms.</p>
