                      <h2>the story</h2>
                      <p>The entrepreneur (Darcy) behind ReFated Shoes, or RFS, is an artist with
                            impeccable style. Bored of the basic blacks and browns, he hand-painted his
                            own shoes in vibrant hues, patina patterns, and however else inspiration took
                            hold of his paint brush. To his surprise, colleagues and passersby were offering
                            to buy the shoes off his feet. So, he decided to take his hobby online. After
                            a successful stint on Etsy, he wanted to make it official with his own site.
                      <p>With our foundation as an Etsy site, design-wise, we were starting from scratch.
                            Below, I outline how we went from this Etsy site to what we have now.</p>

                  <p>Darcy named a few companies with a similar concept. So, we looked them over
                  to see if we could idenfity any aesthetic similarities and key differences. We
                  found that the companies that were just starting out use stone/slate textures and colors,
                  while the more established companies rely on a black and white color scheme with
                  brightly colored photos and calls-to-action.</p>

                  <p>In retail, photography is just as important as the site design.
                    To dispel concerns of condition and quality, the users requested
                    more photos of the finished product as well as the painting process.
                  <p>We discovered that customers want to learn about products prior to
                    purchasing them. In the future, we will explore embedding videos on
                    the website and social media platforms.</p>
