                      <p>The entrepreneur (Darcy) behind ReFated Shoes, or RF, is an artist with
                        impeccable style. Bored of the basic blacks and browns, he hand-painted his
                        own shoes in vibrant hues, patina patterns, and however else inspiration took
                        hold of his paint brush. To his surprise, colleagues and passersby were offering
                        to buy the shoes off his feet. So, he decided to take his hobby online.
                      <p>After a successful stint on Etsy, the entrepreneur decided that it was time to
                        host his own site and define his brand.
                      <p>My role was to help him with strategy, marketing, and design.</p>

                  <p>With our foundation as an Etsy site, design-wise, we were starting from scratch.
                  Below, I outline how we went from this Etsy site to what we have now.</p>

                  <h3>Who's Out There?</h3>
                  <p>Darcy named a few companies with a similar concept. So, we looked them over
                  to see if we could idenfity any aesthetic similarities and key differences. We
                  found that the companies that were just starting out use stone/slate textures and colors,
                  while the more established companies rely on a black and white color scheme with
                  brightly colored photos and calls-to-action.</p>

                  <h3>But first, what do the people want?</h3>
                  <p>Considering the distinct nature of this business - painting second-hand,
                    vintage, or out-of-season shoes - we conducted surveys to see what
                    people thought of the concept and who our ideal user would be.
                    The first survey, with 33 respondents, reconfirmed what we knew:</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>And gave us our target customer: out of the 87.5% of respondents
                          who would pay between $100-$300 for a pair of shoes AND would purchase
                          shoes online, 50% of them would consider buying refurbished shoes.</p>

                          on hand-painted. This term tested well during the website prototype.</p>

                  <h2>what i learned from this experience</h2>
                  <p>In retail, photography is just as important as the site design.
                    To dispel concerns of condition and quality, the users requested
                    more photos of the finished product as well as the painting process.
                  <p>We discovered that customers want to learn about products prior to
                    purchasing them. In the future, we will explore embedding videos on
                    the website and social media platforms.</p>
