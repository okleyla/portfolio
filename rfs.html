                  <p>The entrepreneur (Darcy) behind ReFated Shoes, or RF, is an artist with
                    impeccable style. Bored of the basic blacks and browns, he hand-painted his
                    own shoes in vibrant hues, patina patterns, and however else inspiration took
                    hold of his paint brush. To his surprise, colleagues and passersby were offering
                    to buy the shoes off his feet. So, he decided to take his hobby online.
                  <p>After a successful stint on Etsy, the entrepreneur decided that it was time to
                    host his own site and define his brand. Enter: me. My role was to help him with
                    strategy, marketing, and design.</p>

              <h2>starting from the sole up</h2>
              <p>We needed a better understanding of the environment - who else was doing this?
                How will we convince strangers to buy these shoes? Where should we market the new
                site? And most importantly, how do we set ourselves up to compete?</p>
              <div class="competition">
                  <h3>Who's Out There?</h3>
                  <p>During the stakeholder interview, Darcy identified his competitors and inspiration:</p>
                  <div class="inspo">
                      <p>

                  <p> -->
                  <p>Design pattern: the direct competitors use stone/slate textures and colors,
                    while the sources of inspiration rely on a black and white color scheme with
                    brightly colored calls-to-action.</p>

              <div class="user-research">
                  <h3>But first, what do the people want?</h3>
                  <p>Considering the distinct nature of this business: of painting second-hand,
                    vintage, or out of season shoes, we needed a better understanding of how to
                    market to the target customer. We also needed to identify the target customer.</p>

                      <p>1st Survey: 33 respondents</p>

                      <p>The seven out of eight (87.5%) respondents who would pay between $100-$300 for a
                        pair of shoes, who would also purchase shoes online and 50% would consider buying
                        refurbished shoes.</p>

                      <p class="survey-results">We had to replace the word "refurbished".
                      <p>I conducted another survey to test whether it was the term “refurbished” or the concept
                        behind RF that turned customers away. The word refurbished had to change, so we decided
                        on hand-painted. This term tested well during the website prototype.</p>

                through word-of-mouth. Accordingly, I designed the below user flow to

                      <p>We conducted multiple rounds of guerilla testing and online user testing
                        through Invision. Overall, we received positive feedback on the shoes and
                        the website. Survey respondents were intrigued by the concept and the
                        entrepreneur, while others were keen to order shoes from the prototype.
                        Negative comments were mostly directed towards the concept, rather than
                        the design. This was alleviated by providing additional information on the
                        dyeing process and on the specific shoes that are being sold.</p>

              <h2>what i leared from this experience</h2>
              <p>In retail, photography is just as important as the site design.
                To dispel concerns of condition and quality, the users requested
                more photos of the finished product as well as the painting process.
              <p>We discovered that customers want to learn about products prior to
                purchasing them. In the future, we will explore embedding videos on
                the website and social media platforms.</p>
