                          them increase customer engagement to 1+ interactions
                          daily, especially targeting newly acquired customers
                          (within the last 90 days). The main constraint was
                          that it could not cost more than their already planned
                          labor.</h3>

              <div class="half-right">
              </div>
              <div class="half-left" style="clear:both;">
                  <h3>Before I began the project, I made note of the guiding principles:</h3>
                  <ol><h3>
                      <li>No cost</li>
                      <li>EBITDA positive</li>
                      <li>Increase use of digital payments</li>
                      <li>Increase customers’ net promoter score</li>
                  </h3></ol>
                  <h3>I started by focusing on understanding the company and its apps as well as the market. The client’s business has four different activities: 1) they provide back-end authorization and payment requests, 2) third-party MIS SaaS for banks, which includes support to the banks’ mobile apps, 3) person-to-person (P2P) digital payments, and 4) an application that helps customers manage credit and debit cards, track their budget, make purchases (with interest-free financing at participating stores), and earn rewards. They are seeking help for the fourth product. </h3>
                  <h3>Although the app has more than 1 million downloads on
                    Google Play and ranks #14 on the Apple App Store, the users
                    were not active.</h3>
              </div>
              <div class="half-right">
                  <h3>They saw Amazon Pay as their main competitor because they
                    provide the customers with the tool to pay online and the
                    merchant with the system to acquire the online payments,
                    albeit with the limitation that - at the time in Italy -
                    they do not work beyond the Amazon website.</h3>
                  <h3>Customers and users today: Each product has its own
                    customer base.</h3>
                  <h3><ol>
                      <li>Back-end authorization: Banks and settlement companies</li>
                      <li>Third-party SaaS: Banks</li>
                      <li>P2P app: Users under 18 years old</li>
                      <li>Management app: They were hoping to reach Millennials</li>
                  </ol></h3>
                  <h3><b>Constraints</b>: Other than the financial limitations,
                    a major constraint was the client’s desire to only offer this
                    app to customers who have debit or credit cards affiliated
                    with their company. Partner banks provide cards that are backed
                    by the client’s services and technology, which also meant the
                    app was limited to Italian borders and Italian speakers
                    (wouldn’t be translated).</h3>

                  <h3>After the stakeholder interview and research into the company, I started researching the market. Some of the research was provided by the client since they had conducted a thorough investigation. Major insights include:</h3>
                  <h3><ol>
                      <li>Only 26% of Italians use digital payments. Most
                        people (92% of adults) preferred and used cards.</li>
                      <li>Cash-first. Many merchants in Italy prefer cash over
                        any other type of payment. This may be because it is
                        an SME dominated economy.</li>
                      <li>PayPal is widely used in Italy, however, the
                        traditional bank is still the most frequently used
                        payment tool.</li>
                  </ol></h3>
                  <h3>This meant that there had to be a larger cultural shift
                    towards trusting and understanding digital banking.</h3>
              </div>

              <div class="half-right">
                  <h3>Next, I looked into the management app and the P2P app.
                  I combed through thousands of reviews on Google Play.
                  The Apple Store didn’t allow me to read through the reviews.</h3>

                  <h3>What they loved:</h3>

                      <li>Monthly expense summary</li>
                      <li>Ease of using multiple cards in 1 app</li>

                      <li>Additional languages</li>

                    Luckily, many of them are not as popular in Italy as they are
                    in other countries, and thus provided great idea features
                    for our clients, such as Venmo, Stripe, and Squarespace.

                  bank has to say, while 73% would trust a new financial service

                  <p><b>Motivations</b>: Connect & socialize

                  <h3>Based on these insights, we recommended the following:</h3>
                  <h3>Mobile App Engagement<ul>
                      <li>A more user-friendly dashboard & notifications</li>
                      <li>Integration of the P2P app into the management app to
                        provide a complete user experience to a broader segment</li>
                  </ul></h3>
                  <h3>Additional benefits<ul>
                      <li>More promotions for rewards members, such as discounts
                        and cash-back at partner retailers and for using the
                        application for payments.</li>
                      <li>Additional digital payment options: Poste Pay, reloading metro
                        card, and loan repay.</li>
                      <li>Family budgeting: combine family accounts to track
                        budgets across family members. The parents can distribute
                        allowance through the P2P account, while also tracking
                        spending. This can help incorporate younger members into
                        the formal financial system and start building credit.
                        It also creates brand loyalty at a younger age.</li>

                  <h3>Digital Marketing<ul>

                        social media is widely used by the target segment.</li>

                    that I missed a few opportunities to hone our project idea.
